# Backend

## First time setup

1. Run `npm i` while in the backend directory
2. Set up your environment by creating a file called .env. Copy the contents of the [environemnt template](./.env.template) into the .env file and replace all the placeholder information.

## Running the server

To run the server type `npm run dev`. Note you will need two terminals open if you want to run the backend and frontend at the same time.
